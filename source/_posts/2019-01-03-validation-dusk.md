If youâ€™re testing form validation using Laravel Dusk, youâ€™ve probably hit a scenario where the form submission is blocked by Chrome before itâ€™s sent to the server because of HTML5 form validation.

HTML5 form validation blocks a submission when you add an attribute such as required to an input element, or you use `type="email"`. In your Laravel Dusk tests, youâ€™ll probably see this manifesting as a client-side popup dialog in your failing test screenshots.

This is a really tricky thing to test. Since it happens completely client-side without modifying the DOM, itâ€™s hard to assert that the error appears. Even if you do work out a hacky way to do it, itâ€™s not actually testing that your web applicationâ€™s form validation is working. Youâ€™re essentially just testing that Chrome supports HTML5 form validation, and Iâ€™m sure the Google/Chromium teams have their own tests for that. ðŸ™‚

Your first thought may be to try to disable HTML5 form validation using `ChromeOptions` in `DuskTestCase`. Unfortunately there is no such option. That really only leaves one way: adding the `novalidate` property to your HTML forms. This attribute, when applied to a HTML form, disables the browserâ€™s native form validation. But this has its own drawback in that it disables a perfectly useful feature that probably provides value to your users.

Thankfully, Dusk allows you to **inject JavaScript onto the page at runtime**! Using this feature, we can dynamically inject a small code snippet that iterates over the forms on the page and adds the `novalidate` attribute automatically, **just for your tests**. By adding this browser macro to DuskTestCase:

```php
public static function prepare()
{
    static::startChromeDriver();

    Browser::macro('disableClientSideValidation', function () {
        $this->script('for(var f=document.forms,i=f.length;i--;)f[i].setAttribute("novalidate",i)');

        return $this;
    });
}
```

You can then call it within your tests like so:

```php
$this->browse(function (Browser $browser) {
    $browser->visit('/register')
        ->disableClientSideValidation()
        ->type('email', 'notvalidemail')
        ->click('@submit')

        ->assertPathIs('/register')
        ->assertSee('The email must be a valid email address.');
});
```

And viola! The result is youâ€™re actually testing your applicationâ€™s form validation, and **you donâ€™t have to give up HTML5 form validation to do it**!
